<p>In addition to your quantitative analysis using external sources and site visits that you will do on your own, you will <em>definitely</em> need to talk to residents. This is because while you are analyzing a good deal of data, both objective and subjective, it does not truly reflect the lived experiences of users who interact with the space everyday. You might come across insights that you had never thought would be an issue, or verify a hypothesis you may have formed while doing your secondary research.</p>
<p>It is nearly impossible to give definitive tips on how to make an interview useful for you since a lot depends on the interviewees and their behavior, willingness to talk, ability to describe their experiences, and how they perceive you as a researcher. However, it doesn’t hurt to have the following things in your belt before you start.</p>
<div id="kim" class="section level3" number="13.0.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">13.0.1</span> Things to keep in mind<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#kim"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Before you start talking to people, I recommend getting a good sense of the locality beforehand which is why Table <a href="field-visits.html#tab:four">12.1</a> suggests putting interviews off till your second or third site visit. Don’t appear to be a stranger in the neighborhood.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Familiarize yourself with the surroundings.</strong> It is necessary for you how to refer to various areas of the study site so you can bring it up in conversation. This can be important roads, temples, churches, playgrounds, large shops, and crucial intersections. It can also be in the form of historical information about things that have happened here (for example, maybe a government body has repaved some roads) and how they affected the residents. Keep this related to your research questions and avoid any sensitive topics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Account for language differences.,</strong> but do not be scared of them. While knowing the local language gives you an edge, you’ll find that if you show interest in people, and treat them with patience and respect, they are willing to make the conversation work however they can. I recommend taking a person who knows the language with you if they are willing, it certainly helps move things faster.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Think about how they will perceive you</strong>. You should aim to blend in as much as possible, in terms of behavior, clothing, and appearance. For instance, if the study site mostly has residents from a weaker-socioeconomic background and are wearing mostly slippers or <em>chappals</em>, it would make it easier for you to be a part of their surroundings by doing the same. Dress as simply as possible. As strange as this sounds, we were able to do many more interviews in Ejipura once we started going in simple pants, a plain t-shirt, and <em>chappals</em>. We appeared less intimidating to the locals and encouraged more conversation than if we were to seem like complete outsiders. This depends on the site, of course, and if you’re auditing an area where you feel this won’t be an issue, then it is okay.</p></li>

<p>Finding participants to interview on the street can be challenging since they may have other obligations and may not be willing to participate. It is crucial to consider the participants’ time constraints and not stop people who appear to be in a hurry. Convenience sampling can be used to identify residents in each area of the study site who are willing to participate and approach them when they are in public places such as parks, markets, community centers, sitting outside their houses, or at shops. To avoid any spatial bias, choose people on different streets and in various regions of the study site.</p>
<p>It is important to keep the interviews restricted to 15-20 minutes initially and extend only if it feels like the participants are willing to give you more time. Additionally, before recording any interviews, it is essential to ask the participants for their permission. However, if possible, avoid recording since knowing that they are being recorded or even being asked that question can make people feel uncomfortable. Instead, take quick notes and try to remember as much as you can during the conversation.</p>
<p>Finally, approach interviews with a friendly demeanor! As a researcher coming from outside the community, it’s natural to feel like you’re at a disadvantage when it comes to having a conversation. However, this can actually work in your favor by encouraging people to share more about their experiences and way of life. When your interviewee talks about something you haven’t encountered before, respond with enthusiasm or amazement. By taking on the role of someone who is unfamiliar with the area, you create space for asking questions that might seem silly or obvious <span class="citation">(<a href="ors-setup.html#ref-chiswellLongYouRe2016">Chiswell and Wheeler 2016</a>)</span>. This approach can make your interviewee feel more comfortable sharing their knowledge about the site, and can help you gain valuable insights that you might not have considered otherwise.</p>
<p>Once the interview concludes, elaborate on those notes more to capture as much detail as possible.</p>

<div id="interview-structure" class="section level3" number="13.0.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">13.0.3</span> Interview Structure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interview-structure"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Begin the interview by introducing yourself, explaining the purpose of the interview, and thanking the interviewee for their time. Ensure that the interviewee is comfortable and understands the process and the kind of work you are doing. Simplify this as much as you can for their understanding. Be clear that this is a research exercise that aims to try to dismiss any apprehensions they might have about any other motives. Take notes about who the participant is and try to build their profile:</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is their age, gender, and occupation?</li>
<li>How long have they lived in this neighborhood? Where do they work and how do they get there?</li>
<li>What are their typical daily routines that involve walking around the neighborhood?</li>
<li>Do they own a car? If so, how often do they use it?</li>
<li>Do they use public transportation? If so, how often do they use it? What are the reasons for not using it?</li>
<li>How often do they walk in this neighborhood? How far do they usually go?</li>
</ol>
<p>Once introductions are out of the way, here’s a structure that your interview may follow split into various categories:</p>
<div id="satisfaction" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Satisfaction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#satisfaction"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Start with questions about the interviewee’s satisfaction with their neighborhood streets. Begin with open-ended questions and then follow up with more specific ones. Encourage the interviewee to elaborate on their responses and provide examples.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What makes a street more desirable to walk on for you?</li>
<li>Can you tell me about your biggest issue with the streets here?</li>
<li>Do you feel safe walking at night?</li>
<li>How long do you typically stay out?</li>
<li>What are the streets like in the monsoon? What are they like in the summer?</li>
<li>When do you feel like walking more and why?</li>
<li>Is there enough shade when you walk? Where is it better?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="characteristics-of-streets" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Characteristics of Streets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#characteristics-of-streets"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Move on to questions that explore the characteristics of the streets in the area and how easy it is to walk around. Again, begin with open-ended questions and then ask more specific ones. Encourage the interviewee to describe their experiences and provide examples.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Is it easy to walk around this area for you?</li>
<li>Can you describe the condition of the roads?</li>
<li>Are there footpaths present? Do you need them?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="characteristics-of-the-area" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Characteristics of the Area<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#characteristics-of-the-area"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Finally, ask questions that focus on the overall characteristics of the neighborhood, including the type of people who live there, the availability of facilities and services, and transportation options.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What kind of people live where? What kind of people live in your area?</li>
<li>Which is your nearest park?</li>
<li>Do the streetlights work?</li>
<li>Where do you go to shop?</li>
<li>Why do you travel outside the study site, and for what?</li>
<li>How do you travel outside the study site and within it?</li>
<li>What facilities are missing from your area but you would like them?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Conclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conclusion"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>End the interview by thanking the interviewee for their time and providing contact information if they have any further thoughts or feedback. Ensure that they are comfortable with how the information they provided will be used. You can also offer to provide a summary of the findings or share the final report with the interviewee as a way of showing appreciation for their time and contributions.</p>
