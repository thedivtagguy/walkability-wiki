<p>Combining qualitative and quantitative data is essential to understand issues as complex as mobility fully. However, analyzing both data types can be challenging, and integrating them into a cohesive analysis is often tricky. Here, hybrid assessments can help bridge the gap between qualitative and quantitative studies.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-bother" class="section level2" number="5.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Why bother</h2>
<p>In the previous section, we explored various walkability measures, including an area’s built and natural environment and other essential aspects. While GIS techniques and macro data sources can provide a baseline understanding of the walkability of a site, they often miss out on the unique issues and experiences that residents face on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>In early 2023, <a href="https://www.sensinglocal.in/">Sensing Local</a>, an organization that works on urban and environmental issues in Indian cities, commenced a series of walkability for 24 wards in Bangalore <span class="citation">(<a href="data-sources.html#ref-byiffathRaisingStreets2022">ByIffath 2022</a>)</span>. As of writing this, more than 139 km of footpaths have been audited in 10 wards has been completed. These audits, using collaborative tools and with the help of community volunteers, mapped various street features, such as footpath conditions, street litter, encroachment, and streetlight presence. Although these are important indicators of the neighbourhoods they visited, there may be other problems that these criteria missed.</p>
<p>To better understand the region, another audit of Bangalore’s wards was conducted by ichangemycity in 2016 and produced data for all wards, including Ejipura<span class="citation">(<a href="data-sources.html#ref-ichangemycityEjipuraWard1482016">ichangemycity 2016</a>)</span>. This audit included a broader set of criteria, such as:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Civic Facilities</strong>: Presence of parks, public toilets, bus stops, and waste collection centres.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of life</strong>: Walkability of footpaths and conditions of significant crossings, streetlight presence, and other citizen grievances.</li>
<li><strong>Budget allocation</strong>: Areas of budget allocations and overview of budgeted works.</li>
</ol>
<p>This more comprehensive approach not only provides an understanding of the accessibility of various amenities but also includes qualitative data on what the <strong>residents feel is an issue</strong>.</p>
<p>As researchers, we often study areas that we aren’t familiar with. Therefore, standardized metrics, such as sidewalk measurements, street lighting, and footpath conditions, are crucial for providing a foundational understanding of the walkability of an area. However, relying solely on these metrics can limit our understanding of residents’ unique issues and experiences. Qualitative research can provide valuable insights into the lived experiences of individuals in the community. For example, an on-ground study conducted by community volunteers can reveal micro-scale insights that data analysis using GIS techniques and macro data sources may miss. Section <a href="#interviews-ejipura"><strong>??</strong></a> shows some unique insights that can be gathered from interviews.</p>
</div>
<div id="grassroots-approach" class="section level2" number="5.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Grassroots Approach</h2>
<p>We can use a grassroots approach to designing audits to help fill these quantitative research gaps, often created based on standardized metrics.</p>
<p>Grassroots, also known as bottom-top approaches, focus on collecting data from participants locally instead of entirely relying on higher-level data sources. The grassroots process is particularly relevant in fields such as community development, social justice, and public health, where understanding the experiences and needs of the local community is critical to developing effective interventions or policies and can similarly be applied to inform the assessment process, which can ultimately lead to more effective and inclusive solutions <span class="citation">(<a href="data-sources.html#ref-knapskogExploringWaysMeasuring2019a">Knapskog et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="differences-in-approach" class="section level2" number="5.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.6</span> Differences in Approach</h2>
<p>In most of the walkability audits I have encountered, and others have studied, the qualitative features of streets fail to attract the necessary attention and aren’t investigated. <span class="citation">(<a href="data-sources.html#ref-aghaabbasiEvaluatingCapabilityWalkability2018">Aghaabbasi et al. 2018</a>)</span>. Most studies follow the framework shown in Figure <a href="#fig:usual">5.1</a>.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="images/general-framework.png" style="width:12cm" alt=" A typical walkability assessment" />
<div class="figcaption"> A typical walkability assessment</div>
</div>
<p>This isn’t bad in itself, and if the study aims to audit an environment with the <em>specific</em> intention of only assessing things like sidewalks and streets, that is okay. However, it may not capture the lived experiences of the people who use the space daily. Engaging with local residents and considering their perspectives is essential to gain a more holistic understanding of walkability.</p>
<p>Based on my experience in Ejipura, taking a different approach helped. Instead of assessing standard walkability measures, I went to the site on multiple visits to see what I needed improvement. Since these observations are still detached from what the residents experienced daily, I conducted interviews and other participatory activities to try to answer the fundamental question I outlined above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What does walkability mean to the people who live there?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This process differs from the flow I illustrated above and uses qualitative research to develop the indicators I must assess. Figure <a href="#fig:proposed">5.2</a> outlines my process while studying Ejipura.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="images/proposed.png" style="width:12cm" alt=" Allowing qualitative research to surface quantitative measures" />
<div class="figcaption"> Allowing qualitative research to surface quantitative measures</div>
</div>
<p>This process involved qualitative research to develop indicators that emerged from local knowledge. Using site visits as an essential part of verifying results, I ensured that my insights were grounded in the community context. This approach allowed me to tailor my findings to the specific needs of Ejipura rather than attempting to impose Western models of development that may not be appropriate for Indian cities.</p>
<p>One challenge of using qualitative research is that it can be perceived as unscalable. However, in the following sections, I will demonstrate how I used qualitative data to analyze the environment quantitatively based on the insights gained from interviews and observations. This method can help to bridge the gap between qualitative and quantitative approaches, providing a more comprehensive understanding of walkability in Indian cities. These methods will be demonstrated using Ejipura as the context but can be replicated easily for any other region. Let’s get into it!</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.7</span> Secondary Research</h2>
<p>Chances are, you already know where you’ll be conducting your walkability assessment. This could be your neighborhood, a section of an area you visit often, or even a place you’ve never been to. If you have already narrowed down such a region, <a href="#space-syntax"><strong>??</strong></a> shows you how to identify important and busy streets for your audit. <a href="#secondary-research"><strong>??</strong></a> shows you how to get information about your site’s population, which can help you understand the region’s demographics.</p>
<div id="understanding-the-population" class="section level3" number="5.7.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.1</span> Understanding the population</h3>
<p>In <a href="#levels-of-analysis"><strong>??</strong></a>, we discussed the importance of adding a socio-economic layer of context to our assessments. TLDR; understanding your demographic, income levels, and social makeup can help you show <em>who</em> is being excluded and design your solutions more inclusively. We can use a variety of data sources to view information about the population. I discuss some ways to use this data to identify segregation within areas in Section <a href="assessment-of-segregation.html#identify-segregation">15.2</a></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.2</span> Understanding the space</h3>
<p>You have your region, and you know something about your population. Now how would you decide which streets to audit? Space Syntax Analysis (SSA) can help!</p>
<p>Space syntax analysis is a method of analyzing and understanding the spatial configuration of built environments developed by University College London (UCL) researchers in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>The basic premise of space syntax analysis is that how buildings and cities are configured spatially can significantly impact how people use and interact with those spaces. By analyzing the spatial relationships between different parts of a built environment, space syntax analysis can help reveal movement patterns, interaction, and social activity <span class="citation">(<a href="data-sources.html#ref-vannesIntroductionSpaceSyntax2021">van Nes and Yamu 2021</a>)</span>. This can be done using street networks from OpenStreetMap and DepthMapX, a software dedicated to such analysis.</p>
<div id="components-of-space-syntax-analysis" class="section level4" number="5.7.2.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.7.2.1</span> Components of Space Syntax Analysis</h4>
<p>There are three measures that this method will provide you with. In extremely simple, intuitive terms, these are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Choice:</strong> Choice is a way to measure how likely a street or road segment is to be used by people traveling between different parts of a system. For example, imagine a city and all the different routes people could take to get from one place to another. Choice measures how often a particular street segment is used on the shortest path between any two locations in the system. A high choice value means that many people are likely to use that street segment, while a low choice value means fewer people are likely to use it. So, the choice measures how important a street segment is for connecting different system parts <span class="citation">(<a href="data-sources.html#ref-hillierSocialLogicSpace1984">Hillier and Hanson 1984</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integration</strong>: Integration is a way to measure how close or connected one place is to all the other places in a system. For example, think of a city and its different neighborhoods. Integration measures how easy it is to get from one area to another. The higher the integration, the more connected the neighborhoods are and the easier it is to move around <span class="citation">(<a href="data-sources.html#ref-hillierSocialLogicSpace1984">Hillier and Hanson 1984</a>)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We can use these measures to extrapolate many insights from quantitative data in the form of street networks and build a model for understanding the space. The theory also proposes that the street network adapts and changes over time to intensify local connections, which leads to more efficient movement patterns and porous structures. Essentially, SSA describes how the layout of the street network shapes the development of urban centers and how the evolution of the street network over time influences the formation and location of centers within the urban settlement layout as a whole.</p>

<p>So you’ve chosen your area to audit, but you want to maximize your resources and time and start by auditing the most important streets in the region. If you know the neighborhood, you already know what to do. If not, the <code>choice</code> measure can help you provide a starting point.</p>
<p>First, get the following things ready before moving ahead:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Download DepthmapX</strong>: You can find the relevant copy for your operating system <a href="https://archtech.gr/varoudis/depthmapX/">here</a></li>
<li><strong>Download your region’s OSM street network</strong>: Trim the network to your region of interest so you can process the data faster.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Fire up QGIS</strong>: We’ll use this to convert our street files into an appropriate format for use in <code>DepthMapX</code> and then bring it back here for polishing touches after analysis.</li>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">5.7.2.2.1</span> Step 1. Convert your street network into <code>.mif</code></h5>
<p><code>.mif</code> stands for a MapInfo file, which is a type of digital file that contains information about a map. It is like a virtual version of a paper map that can be opened on a computer. It contains data about different features on the map, such as roads, buildings, and rivers; basically everything you’ll need about your street network to pull it into <code>DepthmapX</code>.</p>
<p><img src="images/Pasted%20image%2020230428221917.png" style="width:10cm" /></p>
