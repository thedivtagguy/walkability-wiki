The ease of mobility on foot, especially in urban areas, has long been overshadowed by the convenience and speed provided by personal vehicles or public transportation systems. Until recently, I was also among those who overlooked and underappreciated its importance. Although I have been aware of the issues with poor infrastructure in cities in India, I never fully grasped the severity of the problem, nor did I connect the individual inconveniences I experienced to a larger systemic issue. Admittedly, this lack of awareness could be viewed as naive or shortsighted, but it is what it is. However, in 2021, my perspective changed when I stumbled upon an Instagram account called “bengawalk” run by Pravar Chaudhary. Through this account, Pravar documented his observations of the streets and people of Bangalore, highlighting a range of issues and interactions that occur on a daily basis. Whether it was a simple post about wayfinding, accompanied by a single hashtag or a video of person crossing a busy street despite being next to a footbridge, to a more complex analysis of traffic congestion and flyovers, the account provided me with a new lens through which to view the city and its challenges. As a designer and a person interested in using data to understand problems, this appealed to me as one of the most tangible, omnipresent topic that I had never fully paid attention to. From there, I have read through countless documents on urban mobility, walkability, transport and streets; admittedly one of the best rabbit-holes I’ve fallen into. The data-storytelling enthusiast in me always wants to find ways to mould information into a spreadsheet I can import into R or a shapefile I can visualize in QGIS, which is what I did with this too. The more I’ve engaged with walkability and urban mobility, though, I’ve realized that quantitative data is often not enough to describe something as complex as streets and transport, or the people who use them. In my research on street usage and accessibiilty in Ejipura, Bangalore, several new insights came up through qualitative analyses that I would have completely missed if I was focusing on large numbers. I was also lucky enough to work with people more experienced than I was who brought with them different, unique ways to analyze urban environments. This book is a distillation of things I, and others, learnt along the way. It is a crowd-sourced, community contributed repository of resuable methodologies anyone can use to explore walkability and accessibility for different contexts. Through qualitative analysis, community engagement, and data-driven approaches such as those discussed here, we can try to gain a deeper understanding of our streets and how they impact individuals from all walks of life. The methodologies presented in this book are just a starting point - there is still much work to be done! "],["scope.html", "Chapter 2 Scope 2.1 What This Is &amp; Isn’t 2.2 Who is this for? 2.3 Content Design", " Chapter 2 Scope There are some things to keep in mind while using this book, so that you make the most of it. 2.1 What This Is &amp; Isn’t This cookbook will: Demonstrate how to combine methods for better understanding walkability. Present real-life case studies to illustrate how this information can be practically used. Provide resources for urban planning professionals, academics, and anyone interested in the field to conduct their own research. Provide a framework for assessing walkability and encourages readers to draw their own conclusions based on their research and analysis But we won’t: Aim to provide an exhaustive list of measures or a comprehensive review of research. Claim to offer a one-size-fits-all solution for assessing walkability. Provide technical guidance on every aspect of GIS and data analysis, only practical techniques and code snippets. Aim to be prescriptive or offer definitive answers on what makes a city or street walkable 2.2 Who is this for? .inline-figure { border: none !important; overflow-x: visible !important; } This book is a valuable resource for a wide range of professionals, academics, and individuals interested in the field of urban planning, design, and development. Specifically, it may be of interest to: For urban planners and designers, this book offers valuable insights on how to assess walkability in cities and neighborhoods. For community advocates, this book provides a framework for promoting walkable neighborhoods and understanding the factors that make them successful. If you’re a researcher, academic, or student in urban planning, public health, or related fields, this book is a great resource for gaining a comprehensive understanding of walkability and its impact on the people that use them. This book isn’t a dry, technical manual. It’s full of real-life case studies and practical techniques that can be used to make cities more walkable. So whether you’re a professional or just someone who loves taking a stroll, this book is for you. 2.3 Content Design .inline-figure { border: none !important; overflow-x: visible !important; } I really like the idea of eat cake first (leon?; cetinkaya-rundel2018?), which means at the heart of this book’s approach is the belief that it’s best to dive in and get started with the task at hand, even if that means adopting a “good enough” approach initially. There may be more complex or nuanced workflows available, and we’ll be sure to point those out as well. Our goal is to provide you with the quickest and most straightforward path to achieving your desired outcome. So, go ahead and eat the cake first, but know that we’ll also provide options for those who want to explore more advanced approaches.

I show some ways to identify segregation, and therefore potential determinants of exclusion, through a social, economic and spatial lens. 10.2 Why it matters Walkability is strongly correlated to health, and many studies have found that populations in more walkable areas are less likely to be obese (Riggs 2016) and perform better on many other health indicators as well (Su et al. 2017). Built environments and the design of neighbourhoods can influence residential behaviours and health consequences, according to accumulating research, with data indicating that these communities not only have lower rates of obesity and overweight people but greater active physical activity engagement as well. When auditing any environment for walkability, therefore, it can be helpful to understand the following: Who are the more vulnerable or advantaged populations? Where are they located? What factors about their built environment and streets make them more vulnerable? Answering these questions will help identify how we can improve an area to ensure an equitable allocation of resources. 10.3 Ways of Identifying Segregation Segregation can occur at various resolutions. The first obvious way to get an overview at a city level is through ward or constituency-level data, which is often easily available. For example, in the case of Bangalore, we can use 2011 census data to find where there are higher percentages of people belonging to scheduled caste/scheduled tribe (SC/ST): Concentration of SC/ST population in various wards of Bangalore 10.4 Social 10.4.1 The Obvious Caste is still the most significant factor in urban residential segregation in India, significantly higher than the level of socioeconomic segregation (Vithayathil and Singh 2012) and Sample infographic and insights from census data 10.4.2 The Less Obvious Aside from the obvious stratification based on caste, what other ways can your study area be divided? Even in a seemingly homogenous area, various factors can influence who lives where. For example, the area could be divided between: Native residents and migrants. Working population by type of work, such as those working in the service industry vs those working in the informal sector. Language: Based on the language spoken by the residents, such as those who speak the local language versus those who speak a different language. Housing tenure: Segregating an area by housing tenure, such as those who rent vs those who own their homes, could reveal disparities in wealth and access to affordable housing. In Ejipura, we were able to identify some micro-neighbourhoods this way. For example, it is a home to many people from the north-east region. We identified the region where the this population was concentrated by observing the kind of shops and restaurants in some areas: Some north-eastern shops in Ejipura Similarly, paying guest accomodations and apartments that are generally for short-term rental for students and working class people are concentrated in another area: PG locations in Ejipura 10.5 Economic Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive source of data that helps us spatially visualize economic segregation. Even the general census does not include questions on consumption levels or economic condition of households. However, you can construct a broad map of income levels based on visual observation of streets and buildings as well. For example, in Ejipura, we used observational and anecdotal evidence to divide the area into three income groups. This was based on the type of housing, condition of streets, and interviews with residents. These are subjective observations by their very nature but some of the things you can look for, in addition to the above, are: Housing type and condition: Look at the type and condition of housing in a given area. Low-income areas may have more rental housing and consist of smaller units. Mid-income regions may have a mix of rental and owner-occupied housing, while high-income areas may have larger, more expensive homes in better condition. Transportation options: Look at the transportation options available in a given area. Low-income areas may have limited access to public transportation and poorer pedestrian infrastructure. In contrast, high-income regions may have more options for alternative transportation and better-maintained roads and sidewalks. Public spaces and amenities: Look at the quality and availability of public spaces and amenities in a given area. Low-income areas may have fewer parks and open spaces, while high-income regions may have more resources and better-maintained public spaces. Such characteristics should be always be considered alongside other variables from census data and income surveys if available, since they are not always reliable markers of income levels. If you’re able to get your hands on enumerator block level census data, which is the smallest unit of census data available, it can help inform these decisions better. Unfortunately, the process of getting access to this data is complicated and very restrictive (as shown on the website for IIM Bangalore). 10.6 Spatial The built environment, through the design of streets and connectivity between them, can also reflect the extent of segregation in an area (Vlachou and Vaughan 2015). It is possible to map the spatial properties of your study area through spatial syntax analysis (SSA), a quantative method to understand the configuration of a built environment and reveal how it is used (Dettlaff, n.d.)
