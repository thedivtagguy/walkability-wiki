<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Walking in a city is an experience that most people take for granted. The ease of mobility on foot, especially in urban areas, has long been overshadowed by the convenience and speed provided by personal vehicles or public transportation systems. Until recently, I was also among those who overlooked and underappreciated its importance. Although I have been aware of the issues with poor infrastructure in cities in India, I never fully grasped the severity of the problem, nor did I connect the individual inconveniences I experienced to a larger systemic issue. Admittedly, this lack of awareness could be viewed as naive or shortsighted, but it is what it is.</p>
<p>However, in 2021, my perspective changed when I stumbled upon an Instagram account called “bengawalk” run by <strong>Pravar Chaudhary</strong>. Through this account, Pravar documented his observations of the streets and people of Bangalore, highlighting a range of issues and interactions that occur on a daily basis. Whether it was a simple post about wayfinding, accompanied by a single hashtag or a video of person crossing a busy street despite being next to a footbridge, to a more complex analysis of traffic congestion and flyovers, the account provided me with a new lens through which to view the city and its challenges.</p>
<p>As a designer and a person interested in using data to understand problems, this appealed to me as one of the most tangible, omnipresent topic that I had <em>never</em> fully paid attention to. From there, I have read through countless documents on urban mobility, walkability, transport and streets; admittedly one of the best rabbit-holes I’ve fallen into. The data-storytelling enthusiast in me always wants to find ways to mould information into a spreadsheet I can import into R or a shapefile I can visualize in QGIS, which is what I did with this too.</p>
<p>The more I’ve engaged with walkability and urban mobility, though, I’ve realized that quantitative data is often not enough to describe something as complex as streets and transport, or the people who use them. In my research on street usage and accessibiilty in Ejipura, Bangalore, several new insights came up through qualitative analyses that I would have completely missed if I was focusing on large numbers. I was also lucky enough to work with people more experienced than I was who brought with them different, unique ways to analyze urban environments.</p>
<p>This book is a distillation of things I learnt along the way.</p>
<p>Through qualitative analysis, community engagement, and data-driven approaches such as those discussed here, we can try to gain a deeper understanding of our streets and how they impact individuals from all walks of life.</p>
<p>The methodologies presented in this book are just a starting point - there is still much work to be done!</p>

<p>I really like the idea of <strong>eat cake first</strong> \parencite{leonIntroductionRstudio4edu, cetinkaya-rundel2018}, which means at the heart of this book’s approach is the belief that it’s best to dive in and get started with the task at hand, even if that means adopting a “good enough” approach initially.</p>
<p>There may be more complex or nuanced workflows available, and I’ll be sure to point those out as well. There might even be better ways to derive insights or understand results, but the methods discussed here are enough to get started with. My goal is to provide you with the quickest and most straightforward path to achieving your desired outcome.<br />
<br />
This also means <strong>no prior knowledge of GIS or programming</strong> is required to follow along. Wherever needed, I will link to appropriate guide material to reduce redundancy of writing it here again. What I <em>will</em> show is how to use those results in a real-life context. I will be using the following to collect data, perform analysis and visualize the results:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><a href="https://openstreetmaps.org"><strong>OpenStreetMaps</strong></a> <strong>(OSM)</strong>: OSM is a crowdsourced mapping tool that is used to collect and update geographic data. It is a free and open-source mapping tool that provides map data and related services to users worldwide. You might compare this to Google Maps, but it is even better because we will be able to <em>pull</em> data from the OSM database and perform analyses</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/"><strong>QGIS</strong></a>: QGIS is a free and open-source geographic information system (GIS) software that is used for creating, editing, visualizing, and analyzing geospatial data.

<p>Combining qualitative and quantitative data is essential to understand issues as complex as mobility fully. However, analyzing both data types can be challenging, and integrating them into a cohesive analysis is often tricky. Here, hybrid assessments can help bridge the gap between qualitative and quantitative studies.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-bother" class="section level2" number="5.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Why bother</h2>
<p>In the previous section, we explored various walkability measures, including an area’s built and natural environment and other essential aspects. While GIS techniques and macro data sources can provide a baseline understanding of the walkability of a site, they often miss out on the unique issues and experiences that residents face on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>In early 2023, <a href="https://www.sensinglocal.in/">Sensing Local</a>, an organization that works on urban and environmental issues in Indian cities, commenced a series of walkability for 24 wards in Bangalore <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-byiffathRaisingStreets2022">ByIffath 2022</a>)</span>. As of writing this, more than 139 km of footpaths have been audited in 10 wards has been completed. These audits, using collaborative tools and with the help of community volunteers, mapped various street features, such as footpath conditions, street litter, encroachment, and streetlight presence. Although these are important indicators of the neighbourhoods they visited, there may be other problems that these criteria missed.</p>
<p>To better understand the region, another audit of Bangalore’s wards was conducted by ichangemycity in 2016 and produced data for all wards, including Ejipura<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ichangemycityEjipuraWard1482016">ichangemycity 2016</a>)</span>. This audit included a broader set of criteria, such as:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Civic Facilities</strong>: Presence of parks, public toilets, bus stops, and waste collection centres.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of life</strong>: Walkability of footpaths and conditions of significant crossings, streetlight presence, and other citizen grievances.</li>
<li><strong>Budget allocation</strong>: Areas of budget allocations and overview of budgeted works.</li>
</ol>
<p>This more comprehensive approach not only provides an understanding of the accessibility of various amenities but also includes qualitative data on what the <strong>residents feel is an issue</strong>.</p>
<p>As researchers, we often study areas that we aren’t familiar with. Therefore, standardized metrics, such as sidewalk measurements, street lighting, and footpath conditions, are crucial for providing a foundational understanding of the walkability of an area. However, relying solely on these metrics can limit our understanding of residents’ unique issues and experiences. Qualitative research can provide valuable insights into the lived experiences of individuals in the community. For example, an on-ground study conducted by community volunteers can reveal micro-scale insights that data analysis using GIS techniques and macro data sources may miss. Section @ref(interviews-ejipura) shows some unique insights that can be gathered from interviews.</p>
</div>
<div id="grassroots-approach" class="section level2" number="5.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Grassroots Approach</h2>
<p>We can use a grassroots approach to designing audits to help fill these quantitative research gaps, often created based on standardized metrics.</p>
<p>Grassroots, also known as bottom-top approaches, focus on collecting data from participants locally instead of entirely relying on higher-level data sources. The grassroots process is particularly relevant in fields such as community development, social justice, and public health, where understanding the experiences and needs of the local community is critical to developing effective interventions or policies and can similarly be applied to inform the assessment process, which can ultimately lead to more effective and inclusive solutions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-knapskogExploringWaysMeasuring2019a">Knapskog et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="differences-in-approach" class="section level2" number="5.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.6</span> Differences in Approach</h2>
<p>In most of the walkability audits I have encountered, and others have studied, the qualitative features of streets fail to attract the necessary attention and aren’t investigated. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-aghaabbasiEvaluatingCapabilityWalkability2018">Aghaabbasi et al. 2018</a>)</span>. Most studies follow the framework shown in Figure @ref(fig:usual).</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="images/general-framework.png" style="width:12cm" alt="(#fig:usual) A typical walkability assessment" />
<div class="figcaption">(#fig:usual) A typical walkability assessment</div>
</div>
<p>This isn’t bad in itself, and if the study aims to audit an environment with the <em>specific</em> intention of only assessing things like sidewalks and streets, that is okay. However, it may not capture the lived experiences of the people who use the space daily. Engaging with local residents and considering their perspectives is essential to gain a more holistic understanding of walkability.</p>
<p>Based on my experience in Ejipura, taking a different approach helped. Instead of assessing standard walkability measures, I went to the site on multiple visits to see what I needed improvement. Since these observations are still detached from what the residents experienced daily, I conducted interviews and other participatory activities to try to answer the fundamental question I outlined above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What does walkability mean to the people who live there?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This process differs from the flow I illustrated above and uses qualitative research to develop the indicators I must assess. Figure @ref(fig:proposed) outlines my process while studying Ejipura.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="images/proposed.png" style="width:12cm" alt="(#fig:proposed) Allowing qualitative research to surface quantitative measures" />
<div class="figcaption">(#fig:proposed) Allowing qualitative research to surface quantitative measures</div>
</div>
<p>This process involved qualitative research to develop indicators that emerged from local knowledge. Using site visits as an essential part of verifying results, I ensured that my insights were grounded in the community context. This approach allowed me to tailor my findings to the specific needs of Ejipura rather than attempting to impose Western models of development that may not be appropriate for Indian cities.</p>
<p>One challenge of using qualitative research is that it can be perceived as unscalable. However, in the following sections, I will demonstrate how I used qualitative data to analyze the environment quantitatively based on the insights gained from interviews and observations. This method can help to bridge the gap between qualitative and quantitative approaches, providing a more comprehensive understanding of walkability in Indian cities. These methods will be demonstrated using Ejipura as the context but can be replicated easily for any other region. Let’s get into it!</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.7.2</span> Understanding the space</h3>
<p>You have your region, and you know something about your population. Now how would you decide which streets to audit? Space Syntax Analysis (SSA) can help!</p>
<p>Space syntax analysis is a method of analyzing and understanding the spatial configuration of built environments developed by University College London (UCL) researchers in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>The basic premise of space syntax analysis is that how buildings and cities are configured spatially can significantly impact how people use and interact with those spaces. By analyzing the spatial relationships between different parts of a built environment, space syntax analysis can help reveal movement patterns, interaction, and social activity <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vannesIntroductionSpaceSyntax2021">van Nes and Yamu 2021</a>)</span>. This can be done using street networks from OpenStreetMap and DepthMapX, a software dedicated to such analysis.</p>
<div id="components-of-space-syntax-analysis" class="section level4" number="5.7.2.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.7.2.1</span> Components of Space Syntax Analysis</h4>
<p>There are three measures that this method will provide you with. In extremely simple, intuitive terms, these are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Choice:</strong> Choice is a way to measure how likely a street or road segment is to be used by people traveling between different parts of a system. For example, imagine a city and all the different routes people could take to get from one place to another. Choice measures how often a particular street segment is used on the shortest path between any two locations in the system. A high choice value means that many people are likely to use that street segment, while a low choice value means fewer people are likely to use it. So, the choice measures how important a street segment is for connecting different system parts <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hillierSocialLogicSpace1984">Hillier and Hanson 1984</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integration</strong>: Integration is a way to measure how close or connected one place is to all the other places in a system. For example, think of a city and its different neighborhoods. Integration measures how easy it is to get from one area to another. The higher the integration, the more connected the neighborhoods are and the easier it is to move around <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hillierSocialLogicSpace1984">Hillier and Hanson 1984</a>)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We can use these measures to extrapolate many insights from quantitative data in the form of street networks and build a model for understanding the space. The theory also proposes that the street network adapts and changes over time to intensify local connections, which leads to more efficient movement patterns and porous structures. Essentially, SSA describes how the layout of the street network shapes the development of urban centers and how the evolution of the street network over time influences the formation and location of centers within the urban settlement layout as a whole.</p>

<p>So you’ve chosen your area to audit, but you want to maximize your resources and time and start by auditing the most important streets in the region. If you know the neighborhood, you already know what to do. If not, the <code>choice</code> measure can help you provide a starting point.</p>
<p>First, get the following things ready before moving ahead:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Download DepthmapX</strong>: You can find the relevant copy for your operating system <a href="https://archtech.gr/varoudis/depthmapX/">here</a></li>
<li><strong>Download your region’s OSM street network</strong>: Trim the network to your region of interest so you can process the data faster.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Fire up QGIS</strong>: We’ll use this to convert our street files into an appropriate format for use in <code>DepthMapX</code> and then bring it back here for polishing touches after analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">5.7.2.2.1</span> Step 1. Convert your street network into <code>.mif</code></h5>
<p><code>.mif</code> stands for a MapInfo file, which is a type of digital file that contains information about a map. It is like a virtual version of a paper map that can be opened on a computer. It contains data about different features on the map, such as roads, buildings, and rivers; basically everything you’ll need about your street network to pull it into <code>DepthmapX</code>.</p>
<p><img src="images/Pasted%20image%2020230428221917.png" style="width:10cm" /></p>
<p>You can do this by right clicking on your street layer and going to <code>Export</code> &gt; <code>Save Features As</code> and selecting <code>.mif</code> from the export dialog box.</p>

<div id="why-it-matters" class="section level2" number="15.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.1</span> Why it matters</h2>
<p>Walkability is strongly correlated to health, and many studies have found that populations in more walkable areas are less likely to be obese <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-riggsInclusivelyWalkableExploring2016">Riggs 2016</a>)</span> and perform better on many other health indicators as well <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-suCommunityDeprivationWalkability2017">Su et al. 2017</a>)</span>. Built environments and the design of neighbourhoods can influence residential behaviours and health consequences, according to accumulating research, with data indicating that these communities not only have lower rates of obesity and overweight people but greater active physical activity engagement as well.</p>
<p>When auditing any environment for walkability, therefore, it can be helpful to understand the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Who</strong> are the more vulnerable or advantaged populations?</li>
<li><strong>Where</strong> are they located?</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> factors about their built environment and streets make them more vulnerable?</li>
</ol>
<p>Answering these questions will help identify <strong>how</strong> we can improve an area to ensure an equitable allocation of resources.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.2</span> Ways of Identifying Segregation</h2>
<p>Segregation can occur at various resolutions. The first obvious way to get an overview at a city level is through ward or constituency-level data, which is often easily available. For example, in the case of Bangalore, we can use 2011 census data to find where there are higher percentages of people belonging to scheduled caste/scheduled tribe (SC/ST):</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">15.3.2</span> The Less Obvious</h3>
<p>Aside from the obvious stratification based on caste, what other ways can your study area be divided? Even in a seemingly homogenous area, various factors can influence <em>who lives where</em>. For example, the area could be divided between:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Native residents</strong> and <strong>migrants</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Working population</strong> by <strong>type of work</strong>, such as those working in the service industry vs those working in the informal sector.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Language</strong>: Based on the language spoken by the residents, such as those who speak the local language versus those who speak a different language.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Housing tenure:</strong> Segregating an area by housing tenure, such as those who rent vs those who own their homes, could reveal disparities in wealth and access to affordable housing.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In Ejipura, we were able to identify some micro-neighbourhoods this way. For example, it is a home to many people from the north-east region. We identified the region where the this population was concentrated by observing the kind of shops and restaurants in some areas:</p>
<div class="float">

<p>Similarly, paying guest accomodations and apartments that are generally for short-term rental for students and working class people are concentrated in another area:</p>

<div id="economic" class="section level2" number="15.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.4</span> Economic</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive source of data that helps us spatially visualize economic segregation. Even the general census does not include questions on consumption levels or economic condition of households.</p>
<p>However, you can construct a broad map of income levels based on visual observation of streets and buildings as well. For example, in Ejipura, we used observational and anecdotal evidence to divide the area into three income groups. This was based on the type of housing, condition of streets, and interviews with residents.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="images/income-01.png" style="width:13cm" alt="Identifying income levels through visual observation" />
<div class="figcaption">Identifying income levels through visual observation</div>
</div>
<p>These are subjective observations by their very nature but some of the things you can look for, in addition to the above, are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Housing type and condition:</strong> Look at the type and condition of housing in a given area. Low-income areas may have more rental housing and consist of smaller units. Mid-income regions may have a mix of rental and owner-occupied housing, while high-income areas may have larger, more expensive homes in better condition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transportation options:</strong> Look at the transportation options available in a given area. Low-income areas may have limited access to public transportation and poorer pedestrian infrastructure. In contrast, high-income regions may have more options for alternative transportation and better-maintained roads and sidewalks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Public spaces and amenities:</strong> Look at the quality and availability of public spaces and amenities in a given area. Low-income areas may have fewer parks and open spaces, while high-income regions may have more resources and better-maintained public spaces.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Such characteristics should be <strong>always</strong> be considered alongside other variables from census data and income surveys if available, since they are not always reliable markers of income levels. If you’re able to get your hands on enumerator block level census data, which is the smallest unit of census data available, it can help inform these decisions better. Unfortunately, the process of getting access to this data is complicated and very restrictive (as shown <a href="https://library.iimb.ac.in/CEBdataset">on the website for IIM Bangalore</a>).</p>

<div id="spatial" class="section level2" number="15.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">15.5</span> Spatial</h2>
<p>The built environment, through the design of streets and the connectivity between them, can also reflect the extent of segregation in an area <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vlachouSuccessionalSegregationGerani2015">Vlachou and Vaughan 2015</a>)</span>. This isn’t to say that the design is intentionally exclusionary, but the inherent properties of the space may contribute to the exclusion of certain groups. The environment can influence the politics that govern it. Therefore, to fully understand how specific groups may be excluded, we need to consider the background and social context surrounding it <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-winnerArtifactsHavePolitics1980">Winner 1980</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>It is possible to map the spatial properties of your study area through <strong>spatial syntax analysis (SSA)</strong>, a quantitative method to understand the configuration of a built environment and reveal how it is potentially used by pedestrians and motorists <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dettlaffSpaceSyntaxAnalysis">Dettlaff, n.d.</a>)</span>. The methodology is highly technical and includes many parameters we can analyse for our area, but we need to concern ourselves with only one metric; <strong>angular step depth</strong>.</p>
<p>In simple terms, <strong>angular step depth</strong> measures how near or <em>accessible</em> areas within the street network are. Well-connected streets with high intersection density allow you to walk from one place to another in lesser time. While this may seem obvious, as the farther you go, the less accessible an area is, the benefit of this analysis is evident when we analyse an area like Ejipura:</p>
<div class="float">

<div class="figcaption">Angular step depth map starting from inner Ejipura</div>
</div>
<p>Here, because of the design of the network, the National Games Village is just as inaccessible for people living in the blue region as the southern tip of the ward, despite being adjacent to each other. The reduced accessibility, whether by design or not, makes the two areas spatially segregated. This understanding, layered with observations on the built environment @ref(social) and through secondary research methods, can provide a valuable starting point for identifying general levels of segregation within an area.</p>
