  abstract = {Rapid urbanisation is a key factor in making public urban infrastructure systems in developing countries overstressed. A public transport system of a city is one of its vital urban infrastructure systems. Good public transport enhances connectivity and mobility, especially for lower income groups making them better participate in the labour market, eventually fostering economic growth and social equity. Therefore, it is important in cities of developing countries to ensure the best possible public transport system given the limited availability of resources. One of the ways to enhance a public transport system is to improve its accessibility with regard to population distribution. The first step is to measure the level of accessibility offered by the current system. Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) is a tool to measure accessibility at various location in a city and spatially visualise it. A case study of Surat, India is used to implement the PTAL. Surat PTAL maps are created for a base year (2016) and future year (2021), superimposed with population density, and compared with Ahmedabad city. PTAL maps could be useful in several ways. Key applications and lessons for planners include guiding future public transport investments, enhancing the urban plan-making process by integrating transport and land use decisions, better informing the parking policy, improving residential location choice, optimising supply locations of affordable and low-cost housing, and better understanding the mobility needs of the urban poor.}

  abstract = {Introduction Insufficient physical activity (PA) is a key contributor for premature mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite the well-documented health benefits of PA, few women achieve the recommended levels of PA. The global average of inactivity among women is higher at 31.7\% compared to 23.4\% for inactive men. The gender gap in PA participation is wider in India where estimates indicate that 44\% women are insufficiently active, compared to 25\% men. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in the city of Chennai, India. Participants (N = 370) were recruited from 155 wards stratified by neighborhood walkability and socio-economic status. The adapted Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale for India (NEWS-India) was used to assess built environment perceptions on density, land-use mix, street infrastructure, aesthetics, traffic and crime safety. Travel and leisure PA were recorded using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Long Form (IPAQ-LF). Study protocols were based on recommendations of the International Physical activity and the Environment Network (IPEN; www.ipenproject.org) and previously used in studies in Brazil, Colombia, and Nigeria. Results A greater number of women reported achieving weekly PA levels from travel-related activities (n = 54, 16.0\%) compared to men (n = 33, 9.8\%). In contrast, a higher percentage of men (n = 75, 22.3\%) met weekly PA recommendations during leisure-time compared to women (n = 54, 16.1\%). Street connectivity (aOR = 3.2, CI = 1.3, 8.0) and land-use mix access (aOR = 3.7, CI = 1.4, 8.2) significantly increased odds of travel PA among women. Conclusions Low engagement in leisure PA among women can be linked to prevailing socio-cultural norms that constrain women's mobility and hinder their participation in PA. Aspects of gender equity in transportation planning are closely linked with citywide indicators of liveability, sustainability and resilience in LMICs like India. Public health practitioners must address gender-specific barriers to increase PA among women through context-specific group exercise programs, peer support and guidance that emphasize the importance of PA.},

  abstract = {Background: Public open spaces (POS) are recognized as important to promote physical activity engagement. However, it is unclear how POS attributes, such as activities available, environmental quality, amenities present, and safety, are associated with neighborhood-level walkability and deprivation. Methods: Twelve neighborhoods were selected within 1 constituent city of Auckland, New Zealand based on higher (n = 6) or lower (n = 6) walkability characteristics. Neighborhoods were dichotomized as more (n = 7) or less (n = 5) socioeconomically deprived. POS (n = 69) were identified within these neighborhoods and audited using the New Zealand-Public Open Space Tool. Unpaired 1-way analysis of variance tests were applied to compare differences in attributes and overall score of POS by neighborhood walkability and deprivation. Results: POS located in more walkable neighborhoods have significantly higher overall scores when compared with less walkable neighborhoods. Deprivation comparisons identified POS located in less deprived communities have better quality environments, but fewer activities and safety features present when compared with more deprived neighborhoods. Conclusions: A positive relationship existed between presence of POS attributes and neighborhood walkability, but the relationship between POS and neighborhood-level deprivation was less clear. Variation in neighborhood POS quality alone is unlikely to explain poorer health outcomes for residents in more deprived areas.}

This paper presents gridded estimates of population at a resolution of 1 km along with two spatial renderings of urban areas—one based on the official tabulations of population and settlement types (i.e., statutory towns, outgrowths, and census towns) and the other on remotely-sensed measures of built-up land derived from the Global Human Settlement Layer. We also cross-classified the census data and the remotely-sensed data to construct a hybrid representation of the continuum of urban settlement. In their spatial detail, these materials go well beyond what has previously been available in the public domain, and thereby provide an empirical basis for comparison among competing conceptual models of urbanization.},

  abstract = {We present the first ever neighbourhood-scale portrait of caste-based residential segregation in Indian cities. Residential segregation studies in Indian cities have relied on ward-level data. We demonstrate in this paper that wards cannot approximate an urban neighborhood, and that they are heterogeneous. For a typical ward, the neighbourhood-ward dissimilarity index is greater than the wardcity dissimilarity index. Using 2011 enumeration block (EB) level census data for five major cities in India – Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai – we show how patterns of caste-based urban residential segregation operate in contemporary India. We also present the first visual snapshot of castebased residential segregation in an Indian city using georeferenced EB level data for Bengaluru. Besides implications for policy, our analysis also points to the need for publicly available, geospatially-linked neighborhood-scale census data that includes data on economic class for a spatial understanding of economic and social stratification within Indian cities.}

One of the strategies of many smart urban mobility policies is to view the transportation system from a holistic perspective to seek reduction of negative effects and an improve performance. Nonetheless, given the rapid technological advances in the transportation sector, there is a need to identify and evaluate primary smart mobility innovations from a sustainability perspective. This article presents a thorough technology review and evaluation of the main smart mobility innovations identified in the literature. The study has identified and categorized six main smart mobility innovations most commonly discussed within the literature including: (a) intelligent transport systems; (b) alternative fuel systems; (c) driving automation systems; (d) shared mobility services; (e) demand responsive transport; and (f) integrated mobility systems. Furthermore, this article includes a brief description of their characteristics, applications, and also evaluates their sustainability according to their proposed impacts on transport safety, road congestion, energy consumption, the environment, and accessibility.}

A trip made on a transit system requires commuters to utilise more than one mode of transport. Walking is generally the most common transport mode to access and egress transit stops. While there is evidence on the pedestrian environment influencing transit ridership, only a few studies have explored how it affects the share of people who walk to/from transits, especially in the context of the developing world. This article postulates that the pedestrian environment influences users' decision to walk the last mile, substantiating it with the findings of a study of transit users across the metro stations of Delhi, India. A pedestrian environment index is developed by including elements of the built form and activities adjacent to the network of streets, in addition to the pedestrian infrastructure quality. Interestingly, the route environment is found to have a significant and much higher correlation with walk share in contrast to pedestrian infrastructure availability. Within the route environment, the sub-indicator that impacts walk share the most is placemaking. It highlights the significance of planning for an enhanced pedestrian environment in a larger context of the catchment area, in contrast to the current myopic approach of station-centric pedestrian infrastructure provisioning.}

Specifically, the paper considers how the particularities of farmer interviews – including the geographical remoteness of many farm holdings, the strength of tradition in farm families and the male-dominated nature of the industry – pose a unique and challenging prospect for the young and relatively inexperienced female researcher. Drawing on a number of the authors’ own fieldwork experiences, we consider some of the ethical and safety challenges we have faced, and offer some practical strategies for addressing these. The paper also reflects on the implications of our positionality – specifically the intersection of our age, gender and non-farming status – on our own, and participants’ interview performances. Although, as we discuss, we found these aspects of our identity broadly advantageous in securing and conducting successful farmer interviews, we also recount how they invited a number of unwelcomed behaviours, and often left us vulnerable to emotional risk. In sharing such experiences, we raise a number of questions concerning the ethical responsibility of negotiating or conforming to the identities conferred on us during farmer interviews and hope to prompt further discussion around these challenges. The paper concludes that young female researchers face a number of ethical and safety challenges during fieldwork in the rural and farming context and highlights the need to consider the impact of researcher positionality on the researcher, the participant(s) and the overall research process. By stimulating such a debate, we aim to bring the issue of gendered experiences of rural research to the fore, and hope to provide some reassurance and support to others working in similar areas.},

The questions how to delineate its character and how it is possible to objectively compare two spaces is a matter under consideration. This was the reason for creating new theories about the structure of space. Space syntax analysis (SSA) or simply Space Syntax defines a number of theories and research areas devoted to the analysis of space configuration. Ongoing research and observations of the configuration of spatial settlements and human behavior within in the past years has shown a close relationship between the physical structure of space and the quality of life of its inhabitants. SSA is used as an academic and commercial tool to analyze projects on an urban and building scale. It is a tool of sustainable development used to study movement of space users, crime in the city, anti-social behavior, economics and viability of service, transport or health behavior.},

Address data come from the 2008 Boston Youth Survey Geospatial Dataset, a school-based sample of public high school students in Boston, MA with complete residential address information (n~=~1,292). GIS data were used to create multiple objective measures of neighborhood walkability and transit availability. We also obtained Walk Scores and Transit Scores. We calculated Spearman correlations of Walk Scores and Transit Scores with the GIS neighborhood walkability/transit availability measures as well as Spearman correlations accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Several significant correlations were observed between Walk Score and 400-m buffer GIS measures of neighborhood walkability; all significant correlations were found for the 800-m buffer. All correlations between Transit Scores and GIS measures of neighborhood transit availability were also significant (all p~{$<~$}0.0001). However, the magnitude of correlations varied by the GIS measure and neighborhood definition. Relative to the 400-m buffer, correlations for the 800-m buffer were higher. This study suggests that Walk Score is a good, convenient tool to measure certain aspects of neighborhood walkability and transit availability (such as density of retail destinations, density of recreational open space, intersection density, residential density and density of subway stops). However, Walk Score works best at larger spatial scales.},

Self-reported behavior and health status from BRFSS served as dependent variables.Results.After controlling for demographic and behavioral covariates, the county sprawl index had small but significant associations with minutes walked (p = .004), obesity (p {$<$} .001), BMI (p = .005), and hypertension (p = .018). Residents of sprawling counties were likely to walk less during leisure time, weigh more, and have greater prevalence of hypertension than residents of compact counties. At the metropolitan level, sprawl was similarly associated with minutes walked (p = .04) but not with the other variables.Conclusion.This ecologic study reveals that urban form could be significantly associated with some forms of physical activity and some health outcomes. More research is needed to refine measures of urban form, improve measures of physical activity, and control for other individual and environmental influences on physical activity, obesity, and related health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Even though mobility is a requirement for participation in “modern life”, the truth is that mobility is unevenly distributed and it constitutes a field of contestation and dispute among social classes. Mobility does not derive from individual decisions or free choices. On the contrary, it is the result of the interaction between individual attributes and social structure. To grasp this interaction, it is necessary to go well beyond observed mobility. This paper explores the unequal access to urban opportunities among different social classes in Montevideo. It does so by computing potential public transport accessibility to two types of crucial opportunities: jobs and education. The paper findings show an unequal distribution of potential mobility, especially for jobs and upper level public education. Primary public schools are an exception, revealing the spatial footprint of the mature Uruguayan social protection network at this level. This paper's approach allows to identify and describe various fields of contestation such as urban form, transit network, the state provision of public goods (in the case of education), through examining the effects of uneven mobility on social goods access and, as a result, on social equity.},

  abstract = {The prevailing approach to transport market segmentation which identifies two distinct groups, “captive” and “choice” users, has widely been used by professionals and scholars despite the ambiguity associated with these terms. Furthermore, conflicting interpretations from the point of view of decision makers and individuals may result in negative policy implications where the needs of captive users are neglected in favour of attracting new users. This study attempts to address these concerns by proposing an alternative segmentation framework that could be applied to any mode of transport, in any regional context, by users and decision makers alike to better guide the development of transport policies. Using the results of a large-scale transportation survey, a series of clustering techniques are employed to derive this alternative approach for segmenting walkers, cyclists, transit and automobile users. The main factors considered in the final clustering analysis are the level of trip satisfaction and practicality. The analysis yielded four market segments: captivity, utilitarianism, dedication and convenience. Using this theoretical framework to understand the distribution of travellers among market segments is essential in identifying distinct and appropriate policy interventions to improve trip conditions. It is hoped that the segmentation approach and policy framework proposed here will encourage a better balance between pragmatic and idealistic goals in transportation policy.},

Through a critical review of literature on growth of cities in South Asia, transport initiatives and policies, and the existing transport situation, this paper highlights barriers which impact accessibility to transport and thus, ridership. As Delhi gears up to become the world's most populated city, how does its transport infrastructure fare in enabling users' ease of movement and providing opportunities to access work, education, healthcare, and social life? The paper explores how challenges to access transport are a result of interactions between several inter-sectional factors. These include an individual's social and spatial position in the city, role of transport policies in shaping road-based transport, and Delhi's growth in the form of urban sprawls which has resulted in uneven distribution of and access to services. At the core of these inter-linked factors lie the users through whom the challenges or opportunities to access transport become operationalised. By highlighting transport-related constraints, including who is considered a user and who is not, this paper pushes for more inclusive discussions on the future of transport planning, and interventions for improving accessibility. Identifying opportunities for actions and addressing gaps is imperative as Delhi witness's continuous growth and migration. This review of existing transport literature is beneficial for policy recommendations and strategies for meaningful change.}

  abstract = {Urban mobility is one of the pressing challenges Dhaka City facing today. Existing car based mobility network has already proven ineffective and thus leads to congestion, inequity and unhealthy urban environment. Even though largest portion of city population travels by walk, pedestrian mobility has been severely compromised especially in newly planned residential areas. Streets here are planned considering automobile as a primary mode of transport; a comfortable setting of walkable streets is almost nonexistent. However, the historic core of the city is an exception where streets are seen dominated by the pedestrian. The paper presents a comparative study of the walkability between planned (Bashundhara R/A) and historic (Shakhari bazar) urban area while taking into account the importance of active mobility for a healthy urban development. The study starts with reviewing theoretical constructs of `pedestrian-friendly community development' while looking into case studies and urban standards in order to synthesize `walkability' matrices. Multiple tools are used to measure walkability of the street. Maps are studied to analyze the physical context of selected urban area, scientific tools are used to collect site specific microclimatic data, observation and questionnaire surveys are conducted to understand user's response. The aim is to formulate a checklist of walkable streetscape in the context of Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study identifies the physical (height width ratio, vegetation, water features, orientation) and functional attributes (location of amenities, infrastructure, safety) of street fabric has strong impact on improving walkability.

  abstract = {This article describes and evaluates a three-step methodology for measuring walkability at neighbourhood-scale, aimed at also being usable for planning practitioners. The methodology was developed as part of a larger study on whether densification in public transport nodes outside city centres in Norwegian cities is a good strategy for reducing traffic in cities, what can be done to increase the traffic-reducing effects, and how improved walkability can be part of this. We define walkability as to what extent the surroundings are nice to walk in, as well as pleasant and interesting, and inviting walking. Criteria for assessing walkability are divided into three categories: Infrastructure and traffic, Urbanity, and Surroundings and activities, with specified attributes attached. Data were collected from existing data sources, fieldwork, and interviews. We used the data to assess degree of walkability for each node on a scale from highly walkable to not walkable and found that walkability of the four investigated nodes varied from not walkable to walkable. The car-driver shares on travels related to the nodes were rather high, and we argue that they could be lowered by among others reducing car accessibility and improving walkability. We experienced that our methodology worked as intended at the neighbourhood-scale. If used at a larger scale, the approach could be supplemented by GIS tools. Interviews indicate that our perceptions as researchers are not necessarily in accordance of those of users of the streets. Use of Public Participation GIS tools could give a better understanding of these differences, and how this might be dealt with. Making cities more walkable is increasingly understood as a necessary part of sustainable urban development. By sharing experiences from using our methodology, we hope to contribute with relevant input to the ongoing discussions in cities across the world on how to measure walkability and how to develop cities and areas to become more walkable.},

  abstract = {The current trends of urban dynamics in the Third World are alarming with regard to climate change, because they are giving an increasingly important role to cars— to the detriment of public and non-motorized transportation. Yet this is the type of energy consumption that is expected to grow the fastest, in business-as-usual scenarios. How can these market-based urban trends be influenced? What level of emissions reduction can be achieved? This article shows that first, there is a relevant and urgent need to tackle the urban dynamics of cities in developing countries focusing on the “transport– land uses” couple, and second, that existing transport technologies and decision-helping tools are already available to take up the climate change challenge. Through the application of an integrated “transport– land uses” model, TRANUS, this study demonstrates that transit technologies affordable to an emerging city like Bangalore can significantly curb the trajectories of energy consumption and the ensuing carbon dioxide emissions, if and only if they are implemented in the framework of appropriate urban planning. Furthermore, this study establishes that there are tools which are available to facilitate the necessary policy-making processes. These tools allow stakeholders to discuss different political alternatives integrating energy issues, based on quantitative assessments.},

  abstract = {Transport is a critical system in the city, which, through providing access to essential activities, enables diverse women and men, girls and boys to ?appropriate? their right to the city and to realize a fully rounded and substantive urban citizenship. Yet, despite decades of work on gender in urban development and urban planning, mainstream transport planning still remains largely untouched by debates on diversity and difference in cities. The tendency to focus on the economic and now environmental aspects continues to dominate urban transport. In contrast, concerns for the identity of urban residents or ?users? are addressed through, and ultimately marginalized to, ?the social? and distributional aspects of urban transport planning. This paper argues that the distributional aspects of transport are cross cutting, and go beyond the disaggregation of transport users by social relations such as class, gender, age and ethnicity. The social identities of transport ?users? are deeply embedded in social relations and urban practices, the latter ranging from the everyday lives of people to urban policies and planning. Furthermore, in transport, these social relations are played out in public space, with implications for how diverse women and men, girls and boys are able to exercise individual and collective ?travel choice? and negotiate access to essential activities in the city. Recognition of these processes, as reflected in the ?deep distribution? of the transport system, is essential to reframing the notion of ?travel choice? and, ultimately, to urban transport and urban planning that is committed to social justice in cities.}

Given high levels  of racial segregation and elevated rates of Black poverty, it is  axiomatically true that African Americans will experience more  neighborhood poverty than other groups. Moreover, because poverty is  associated with crime and delinquency, they will also be exposed to far  higher rates of social disorder and violence. In this article I argue  that long-term exposure to social disorder and violence because of  segregation produces a high allostatic load among African Americans,  which leads, in turn, to a variety of deleterious health and cognitive  outcomes. After summarizing recent research on stress and allostatic  load, I specify a biosocial model of racial stratification and draw  upon it to explicate well-documented racial differentials with respect  to health and cognition.},

  author = {Moncure, Patricia},
  date = {2017-01-01},
  abstract = {Background: Mobility is a fundamental determinant of when and how people access resources, such as medical care, economic opportunity, outdoor recreation and nutritious food. Urban infrastructure should support multiple mobility options to encourage active transport, improve individual and community health, and reduce congestion in growing urban cities. In this study, we use a mobility equity index to assess the balance of mobility options (biking, walking, public transit, and driving) at the neighborhood level and in areas surrounding healthy food retail. The resulting mobility equity values were then tested against sociodemographic and structural characteristics of neighborhoods, such as urbanicity, vehicle availability, and income, to assess for association between mobility equity and neighborhood factors. \^ Methods: ArcGIS was used to aggregate data from the City of Austin Open Data Portal and the 2015 U.S. Census, American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, at the Census Block Group (neighborhood) level. In SAS, four constructs of mobility— walkability, bikability, drivability, and public transit accessibility— were calculated for each neighborhood, normalized, and then converted to a relative range (0 – 1). The scaled constructs were used to calculate a mobility equity index for each neighborhood. Logistic regression was used to model the association between high mobility equity and vehicle availability, household income, urbanicity, and racial/ethnic characteristics of neighborhoods. Odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals were used to interpret significant associations. Finally, the new mobility equity index was used in a case study to examine transportation options surrounding healthy food retail. 3-mile network buffers were created in ArcGIS around the healthy food retail point locations. Descriptive statistics were generated for the healthy food buffer areas to evaluate differences in accessibility of stores based on income, majority race/ethnicity, vehicle availability, and urbanicity of the area surrounding the store. \^ Results: Significant associations were found between high mobility equity index values and the odds of living in a neighborhood that is low-income, has high vehicle availability, and is majority Hispanic (respectively). No association was found between urbanicity and mobility equity. Healthy food stores in the downtown/central Austin tended to have the highest mobility equity values, as compared to those in North Central Austin or far south. Additionally, stores with higher mobility equity tended to be in areas that are majority mixed race/ethnicity, low income, and have high vehicle availability. \^ Conclusion: The development and demonstration of a mobility equity index is an innovative approach to addressing pressing infrastructure concerns as urban cores continue to grow in population. We can conclude the relationship between mobility and sociodemographic factors is complex, though mobility equity may be higher amongst low-income populations due to societal norms that suggest alternative transportation is for the lower class. Future studies should validate this mobility equity index; consider additional data to utilize in mobility constructs; and, conduct a study across multiple cities in order to compare mobility across multiple urban environments.}

  abstract = {Purpose. This paper reviews existing environmental audit instruments used to capture the walkability and bikability of environments. The review inventories and evaluates individual measures of environmental factors used in these instruments. It synthesizes the current state of knowledge in quantifying the built environment. The paper provides health promotion professionals an understanding of the essential aspects of environments influencing walking and bicycling for both recreational and transportation purposes. It serves as a basis to develop valid and efficient tools to create activity-friendly communities. Data Sources. Keyword searches identified journal articles from the computer-based Academic Citation Databases, including the National Transportation Library, the Web of Science Citation Database, and MEDLINE. Governmental publications and conference proceedings were also searched. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. All instruments to audit physical environments have been included in this review, considering both recreation- and transportation-related walking and bicycling. Excluded are general methods devised to estimate walking and cycling trips, those used in empirical studies on land use and transportation, and research on walking inside buildings. Data Extraction Methods. Data have been extracted from each instrument using a template of key items developed for this review. The data were examined for quality assurance among three experienced researchers. Data Synthesis. A behavioral model of the built environment guides the synthesis according to three components: the origin and destination of the walk or bike trip, the characteristics of the road traveled, and the characteristics of the areas surrounding the trip's origin and destination. These components, combined with the characteristics of the instruments themselves, lead to a classification of the instruments into the four categories of inventory, route quality assessment, area quality assessment, and approaches to estimating latent demand for walking and bicycling. Furthermore, individual variables used in each instrument to measure the environment are grouped into four classes: spatiophysical, spatiobehavioral, spatiopsychosocial, and policy-based. Major Conclusions. Individually, existing instruments rely on selective classes of variables and therefore assess only parts of built environments that affect walking and bicycling. Most of the instruments and individual measures have not been rigorously tested because of a lack of available data on walking and bicycling and because of limited research budgets. Future instrument development will depend on the acquisition of empirical data on walking and bicycling, on inclusion of all three components of the behavioral model, and on consideration of all classes of variables identified.}

  abstract = {Disparity in spatial accessibility is strongly associated with growing inequalities among urban communities. Since improving levels of accessibility for certain communities can provide them with upward social mobility and address social exclusion and inequalities in cities, it is important to understand the nature and distribution of spatial accessibility among urban communities. To support decision-makers in achieving inclusion and fairness in policy interventions in cities, we present an open and data-driven framework to understand the spatial nature of accessibility to infrastructure among the different demographics. We find that accessibility to a wide range of infrastructure in any city (54 cities) converges to a Zipf?s law, suggesting that inequalities also appear proportional to growth processes in these cities. Then, assessing spatial inequalities among the socioeconomically clustered urban profiles for 10 of those cities, we find urban communities are distinctly segregated along social and spatial lines. We find low accessibility scores for populations who have a larger share of minorities, earn less and have a relatively lower number of individuals with a university degree. These findings suggest that the reproducible framework we propose may be instrumental in understanding processes leading to spatial inequalities and in supporting cities to devise targeted measures for addressing inequalities for certain underprivileged communities.}

  abstract = {Background: Children growing up in poor versus affluent neighborhoods are more likely to spend time in prison, develop health problems and die at an early age. The question of how neighborhood conditions influence our behavior and health has attracted the attention of public health officials and scholars for generations. Online tools are now providing new opportunities to measure neighborhood features and may provide a cost effective way to advance our understanding of neighborhood effects on child health. Method: A virtual systematic social observation (SSO) study was conducted to test whether Google Street View could be used to reliably capture the neighborhood conditions of families participating in the Environmental-Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study. Multiple raters coded a subsample of 120 neighborhoods and convergent and discriminant validity was evaluated on the full sample of over 1,000 neighborhoods by linking virtual SSO measures to: (a) consumer based geo-demographic classifications of deprivation and health, (b) local resident surveys of disorder and safety, and (c) parent and teacher assessments of children’s antisocial behavior, prosocial behavior, and body mass index. Results: High levels of observed agreement were documented for signs of physical disorder, physical decay, dangerousness and street safety. Inter-rater agreement estimates fell within the moderate to substantial range for all of the scales (ICCs ranged from .48 to .91). Negative neighborhood features, including SSO-rated disorder and decay and dangerousness corresponded with local resident reports, demonstrated a graded relationship with census-defined indices of socioeconomic status, and predicted higher levels of antisocial behavior among local children. In addition, positive neighborhood features, including SSO-rated street safety and the percentage of green space, were associated with higher prosocial behavior and healthy weight status among children. Conclusions: Our results support the use of Google Street View as a reliable and cost effective tool for measuring both negative and positive features of local neighborhoods.},

The research used mix methods and case study approach to achieve study objectives. The mix methods include onsite observation, visual survey and questionnaire with students using walkability checklist to determine the walking quality on streets sidewalks. In this regard four variables are considered based on previous literature review as; safety and pedestrians’ facilities, comfortable walking environment, walking connectivity and lastly walking attractiveness. The result shows that the lack of safety and pedestrian facilities, poor designed sidewalks and connectivity leads to low level of walkability and increase car dependency in the study area. The findings provide guidelines for increasing the efficiency of walking, in order to encourage students to choose walking over car driving.},

  abstract = {Background Research indicates that neighborhood environment characteristics such as physical disorder influence health and health behavior. In-person audit of neighborhood environments is costly and time-consuming. Google Street View may allow auditing of neighborhood environments more easily and at lower cost, but little is known about the feasibility of such data collection. Purpose To assess the feasibility of using Google Street View to audit neighborhood environments. Methods This study compared neighborhood measurements coded in 2008 using Street View with neighborhood audit data collected in 2007. The sample included 37 block faces in high-walkability neighborhoods in New York City. Field audit and Street View data were collected for 143 items associated with seven neighborhood environment constructions: aesthetics, physical disorder, pedestrian safety, motorized traffic and parking, infrastructure for active travel, sidewalk amenities, and social and commercial activity. To measure concordance between field audit and Street View data, percentage agreement was used for categoric measures and Spearman rank-order correlations were used for continuous measures. Results The analyses, conducted in 2009, found high levels of concordance (≥80\% agreement or ≥60\% Spearman rank-order correlation) for 54.3\% of the items. Measures of pedestrian safety, motorized traffic and parking, and infrastructure for active travel had relatively high levels of concordance, while measures of physical disorder had low levels. Features that are small or that typically exhibit temporal variability had lower levels of concordance. Conclusions This exploratory study indicates that Google Street View can be used to audit neighborhood environments.},

  abstract = {This paper attempts to reframe debates on the equity implications of spatial, socioeconomic, and political change in global cities in developing countries through a review of recent literature on this topic. It begins by critiquing the view that global cities in developing countries are converging around a model of development similar to that of the prototypical global cities of the United States, Europe, and Japan. It argues that three emerging perspectives hold the key to an analysis that better accounts for local agency and divergent outcomes in such cities: a focus on the diversity of cities' experience with globalization; recognition of the inherently negotiated nature of global impacts on urban outcomes; and a focus on actor-centered perspectives in urban analysis. The combined influence of these ideas amounts to a shift from a focus on global city `models' to an examination of the interaction between global and local actors and institutions in a particular setting. Building on this literature review, the paper suggests an alternate framework for analyzing the link between global city development and inequality that focuses on three processes of change: the formation of public– private partnerships in urban governance, the spatial implications of the privatization of planning, and the flexiblization of labor. It argues that a focus on these processes has important implications for both theory and practice, as it allows us to understand similarity and difference in urban development, and more importantly, to understand the actors, institutions and interests that are driving change.},

  abstract = {International land use planners tend to focus on walkability that could shape both residential behaviors and health outcomes. Understanding the relationships among community deprivation, walkability, and health outcomes will provide insights into appropriate land use planning that supports public health promotion. This paper develops a revised Walk Score tool for measuring community walkability in China. Under the original Walk Score methodological framework, (1) 6 principle amenities (19 items) and their weight (utilization frequency) are first selected by expert panel evaluation and questionnaire survey; (2) a tolerance time approach is then employed to determine the decay function, and the walking travel time from community to each amenity is calculated by using the Baidu Map; and (3) three pedestrian characteristic factors (intersection density, block length, and slope) are considered to adjust the score. We apply the proposed methodology to the case of Shenzhen and discover great variations in walkability among the 8117 communities within it. The high–high clusters are located in the central blocks, while the low–low clusters emerge in the outskirts. Using spatial regression, we observe significant negative associations between community walkability and three health indicators (cardiopathy, hypertension, and liver cancer). It suggests that better health outcomes would be observed in more walkable communities. We further find that children concentrated and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities exhibit lower walkability. These results evidence the significant social inequalities in walkability among the communities of Shenzhen. Path analysis identifies complex linkages among community deprivation, walkability, and public health. For cadiopathy and hypertension, three categories of significant paths are identified: (1) residents in deprived community have worse health outcomes due to lower walkability; (2) poorer health outcomes occur in deprived communities as a result of higher PM2.5 exposure; and (3) less walkable communities are exposed to greater PM2.5 concentration and deprived communities are generally characterized by lower walkability and consequently have worse health outcomes. We argue that social inequalities in walkability should attract the attention of land use planners. In order to address this pressing issue, three areas should be given priorities in future land use planning: (1) adopting urban form-based zoning schemes; (2) economic inputs for streetscape improvements; and (3) formulating affordable and low-renting housing policies. Findings of this case should generate more generalized knowledge that enhances public health promotion within the land use planning context.},

The methodology consists of determination of different indicators of sustainability pillars and thus the Composite Sustainability Index (CSI) before and after introduction of a transportation policy. Indicators include air pollution indicators, natural resource consumption indicators, health indicators, accessibility indicators, mobility indicators, commute indicators, and cost indicators. CSI is obtained by summing all these indicators after weighing them using an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The indicator value under a transportation policy scenario is obtained using the mode shift found using a mode choice model incorporated with the policy variable. The second part consists of a case study for the city of Bangalore where the sustainability impact due to introduction of congestion pricing in the CBD, during peak hour, is tested. A choice model developed from Revealed Preference data (RP) is used in the study. The choice model estimated a reduction of 14.11\% and 2.4\% respectively in the total trip distance travelled by car and bike trips after introduction of congestion charging. There was also an increase of 1.7\% in CSI because of congestion pricing.},

Previous research has suggested that despite its negative effects, segregation can be positive as a key mode of accommodating urban diversity. In this context, this study asks what is the role of space in shaping immigrant segregation patterns and accommodating difference. Although Greece has accepted major migration waves during the last decades, the Greek state is characterised by the lack of internal policies towards immigrants’ integration, leading to social friction. The district of Gerani reflects the current socioeconomic and spatial transformations of the Greek capital and is chosen for this study as a multi-ethnic district and the most distinct commercial immigrant centre of Athens. The existence of a certain degree of informality that characterises both the built environment and the local economic activities reveal the structure of spontaneous socioeconomic patterns. After establishing the spatial properties of the area through space syntax analysis, the immigrant networks are mapped through primary ethnographic research tracking the development of immigrant economic activities. Finally, the above analyses are combined qualitatively and quantitatively, through statistical analysis. The study suggests that Gerani’s spatial configuration might be related to its consistent deprivation and, consequently, to the concentration of high immigrant densities. Furthermore, despite the supposed homogeneity of the “ghetto” of Gerani, the various ethnic groups appear clustered in the area in terms of economic activities and use of the public realm, while an internal hierarchical rationale emerges; locations characterised by higher levels of “natural movement” and proximity to attractors have clusters of those immigrants who have achieved greater social integration with Greek society, whilst locations with lowers levels of “natural movement” and adjacent to abandoned enclaves of anomy have concentrations of the more socially disadvantaged groups. Overall, the issue of immigrant integration and segregation remains mainly a political issue that premises the adoption of long term external and internal policies. Considering, however, the role of spatial design in this process, the current study proposes that specific spatial structures offer immigrants the necessary protection to gradually build their socioeconomic life. These principles should be re-interpreted and assimilated in strategic design proposals and policies that aim at the creation of more socially inclusive solutions.},

  abstract = {Built environment neighborhood characteristics are difficult to measure and assess on a large scale. Consequently, there is a lack of sufficient data that can help us investigate neighborhood characteristics as structural determinants of health on a national level. The objective of this study is to utilize publicly available Google Street View images as a data source for characterizing built environments and to examine the influence of built environments on chronic diseases and health behaviors in the United States. Data were collected by processing 164 million Google Street View images from November 2019 across the United States. Convolutional Neural Networks, a class of multi-layer deep neural networks, were used to extract features of the built environment. Validation analyses found accuracies of 82\% or higher across neighborhood characteristics. In regression analyses controlling for census tract sociodemographics, we find that single-lane roads (an indicator of lower urban development) were linked with chronic conditions and worse mental health. Walkability and urbanicity indicators such as crosswalks, sidewalks, and two or more cars were associated with better health, including reduction in depression, obesity, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Street signs and streetlights were also found to be associated with decreased chronic conditions. Chain link fence (physical disorder indicator) was generally associated with poorer mental health. Living in neighborhoods with a built environment that supports social interaction and physical activity can lead to positive health outcomes. Computer vision models using manually annotated Google Street View images as a training dataset were able to accurately identify neighborhood built environment characteristics. These methods increases the feasibility, scale, and efficiency of neighborhood studies on health.},
